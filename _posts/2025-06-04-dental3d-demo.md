## Dental 3D - Which teeth to be fixed?

[![Dental 3D - Demo 1](https://img.youtube.com/vi/KnZu1PB_Sq8/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/KnZu1PB_Sq8) 

It is December 31, 2029. I am designing a new look for my face. These teeth are marked to be re-designed before sending to my Orthodontist GPT. Once approved, I will sleep with my Toothie 1800 3-D printing machine in my mouth. Hopefully, I wake up with these new look before the New Year party tomorrow.

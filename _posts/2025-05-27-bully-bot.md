## What you do if your VR bot bullying you?

This week I connected Xbox controller to the Vision Pro and test it with my Unity app that ported with PolySpatial. Here are my observations:

- The controller interface works straight away without modification to source code
- You ought to be looking at the object (player) that you want to move, while moving it! Otherwise, the controller will no work! This was a little counter intuitive as normally you would look at where you want to go, not the object that should move.
- And the bullying robot

Enjoy
